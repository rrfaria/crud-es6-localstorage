Create your account on cloudnary and then make sure you did the fallow steps:

* go to there : [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)

* get cloud name on Account Details and you can use upload without api key. Just go to settings 
click in upload and go to Upload presets. Now you have to enable Unsigned uploading
